# devon4ng-ionic-application-template
This repository contains a basic template of an ionic 5 application, which implements common functionalities such as: login, language settings and interaction with a database (delete, add, modify and update data).

## Dependencies

To run the commands command on the "How to use" section, a Node.js installation with the package ionic is needed.

This application also uses [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/) to access to native functionalities, so the capacitor module has to be installed.

To show the template on android devices, it is necessary to have [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and Android SDK.


|  NOTE: |  devonfw console comes with an Node.js and Ionic installation. |
